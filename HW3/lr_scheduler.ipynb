        "\n",
        "So far we primarily focused on optimization *algorithms* for how to update the weight vectors rather than on the *rate* at which they are being updated. Nonetheless, adjusting the learning rate is often just as important as the actual algorithm. There are a number of aspects to consider:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Most obviously the *magnitude* of the learning rate matters. If it is too large, optimization diverges, if it is too small, it takes too long to train or we end up with a suboptimal result. We saw previously that the condition number of the problem matters (see e.g., :numref:`sec_momentum` for details). Intuitively it is the ratio of the amount of change in the least sensitive direction vs. the most sensitive one.\n",
        "* Secondly, the rate of decay is just as important. If the learning rate remains large we may simply end up bouncing around the minimum and thus not reach optimality. :numref:`sec_minibatch_sgd` discussed this in some detail and we analyzed performance guarantees in :numref:`sec_sgd`. In short, we want the rate to decay, but probably more slowly than $\\mathcal{O}(t^{-\\frac{1}{2}})$ which would be a good choice for convex problems.\n",
        "* Another aspect that is equally important is *initialization*. This pertains both to how the parameters are set initially (review :numref:`sec_numerical_stability` for details) and also how they evolve initially. This goes under the moniker of *warmup*, i.e., how rapidly we start moving towards the solution initially. Large steps in the beginning might not be beneficial, in particular since the initial set of parameters is random. The initial update directions might be quite meaningless, too.\n",
        "* Lastly, there are a number of optimization variants that perform cyclical learning rate adjustment. This is beyond the scope of the current chapter. We recommend the reader to review details in :citet:`Izmailov.Podoprikhin.Garipov.ea.2018`, e.g., how to obtain better solutions by averaging over an entire *path* of parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "Given the fact that there is a lot of detail needed to manage learning rates, most deep learning frameworks have tools to deal with this automatically. In the current chapter we will review the effects that different schedules have on accuracy and also show how this can be managed efficiently via a *learning rate scheduler*.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Toy Problem\n",
        "\n",
        "We begin with a toy problem that is cheap enough to compute easily, yet sufficiently nontrivial to illustrate some of the key aspects. For that we pick a slightly modernized version of LeNet (`relu` instead of `sigmoid` activation, MaxPooling rather than AveragePooling), as applied to Fashion-MNIST. Moreover, we hybridize the network for performance. Since most of the code is standard we just introduce the basics without further detailed discussion. See :numref:`chap_cnn` for a refresher as needed.\n"

In particular they find that a warmup phase limits the amount of divergence of parameters in very deep networks. This makes intuitively sense since we would expect significant divergence due to random initialization in those parts of the network that take the most time to make progress in the beginning.\n",

        "* Decreasing the learning rate during training can lead to improved accuracy and (most perplexingly) reduced overfitting of the model.\n",
        "* A piecewise decrease of the learning rate whenever progress has plateaued is effective in practice. Essentially this ensures that we converge efficiently to a suitable solution and only then reduce the inherent variance of the parameters by reducing the learning rate.\n",
        "* Cosine schedulers are popular for some computer vision problems. See e.g., [GluonCV](http://gluon-cv.mxnet.io) for details of such a scheduler.\n",
        "* A warmup period before optimization can prevent divergence.\n",
        "* Optimization serves multiple purposes in deep learning. Besides minimizing the training objective, different choices of optimization algorithms and learning rate scheduling can lead to rather different amounts of generalization and overfitting on the test set (for the same amount of training error).\n",
